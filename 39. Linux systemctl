Adjusting the system state...4 types of target
graphical.target, multi-user.target, rescue.target, emergency.target

#systemctl get-default (u will see graphical.target)
#systemctl isolate multi-user.target (u will get into command line interface)
#systemctl set-default multi-user.target (to set permanently)
#systemctl get-default (u will see multiuser.target)
#systemctl isolate multi-user.target
To go in graphical
#systemctl isolate graphical.target
#systemctl set-default graphical.target(to set permanently)
#systemctl get-default (check, it will be graphical.target now)


#systemctl isolate rescue.target (rescue mode.. for troubleshooting)
